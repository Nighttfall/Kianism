                        <strong>Kian, my dearest.</strong>
                        <p>
                           I’m so grateful that God brought you into my life and 
                            gave me the chance to know you. Thank you for allowing me 
                            to get close to you. I deeply apologize if I ever made 
                            you feel uncomfortable, even in the slightest way, or if
                            I let you down over small misunderstandings.
                            </p><p>
                            I’m truly glad I met you and that I was once loved by 
                            you. I wish you endless happiness and hope you’re always 
                            surrounded by people who love you most. Thank you for 
                            always doing your best and for holding on through 
                            everything. I’m proud of all that you’ve done and all 
                            that you are, Kian.
                        </p><p>
                            Please remember, you don’t have to be a perfect human—
                            just be yourself. You’re never alone in this life. Don’t 
                            hesitate to reach out for help whenever you need it. 
                            Don’t kys; your existence matters—to me, your other 
                            friends, and your future lover. /s
                        </p><p>
                            I hope your life will always be filled with love, 
                            happiness, good friends, and positive energy.
                        </p>
